This little project makes an ATtiny tell you when it is dark or bright. This project is an excellent introduction to the capabilities of the ATtiny85 chip. One of the biggest takeaways for me was learning how to document a project that others could use. I encountered some difficulties with programming the ATtiny chip but after a bit of googling everything was working great. To date, this instructable has 2.6k views.
