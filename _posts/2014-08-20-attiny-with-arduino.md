A quick guide on getting the Arduino IDE to upload code to an Attiny chip. I created this instructable after experiencing some difficulties trying to get the Arduino IDE to work with the Attiny chip. I think my biggest take away was posting my own solution to the internet in the hopes that someone else wouldn't have to experience it. After using so many online tutorials to learn how to code, it felt great to contribute back in my own little way. .
