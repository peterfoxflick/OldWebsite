This flower pot has a built-in sensor that detects when the soil is dry and lets you know. The circuit uses an ATtiny85 as the brain and copper tape as the sensor. For me, this project was the first published creation of my own original thought. It wasn't a copy of someone else's work with my own twist. It was fun putting different pieces together to create my own masterpiece.
