This is my follow along coding project from the Lynda course on learning Ruby on Rails. Previously I have made a twitter clone following the Rails for Zombies course. I like the Rails programming environment and find its prioritization of convention over configuration to not only help save time but also keep your site organized. It is an excellent language in my opinion.
