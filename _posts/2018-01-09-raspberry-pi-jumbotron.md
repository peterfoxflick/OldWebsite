The raspberry jumbotron is my collection of codes and terminal lines I ran to get a kiosk functioning at my work. Every hour it updates the webpage and every night it restarts. When powered up the raspberry pi goes to a URL, which in this case is a public Google Slide. This allowed everyone on our team to contribute to our office's jumbotron that shares announcements and fun tips.
